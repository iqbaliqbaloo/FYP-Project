## About

WellVia is an innovative AI-powered web application designed to function as a virtual medical assistant. It aims to make healthcare more accessible by providing users with intelligent features such as symptom analysis, medication reminders, health tracking, and doctor location servicesâ€”all in one platform.

Using advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques, WellVia interacts with users through a chatbot to understand their health concerns and offer preliminary medical guidance. This reduces the dependency on physical visits for basic health issues and helps users manage their well-being proactively.

Built with a modern web technology stack (React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB), WellVia offers a scalable, secure, and user-friendly experience. The project focuses on improving early diagnosis, increasing patient engagement, and empowering individuals with better health management tools, especially those with limited access to healthcare professionals.
